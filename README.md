Thanks to : Dazzle

## Description

Dazzle Socket is a component that implements asynchronous tcp, udp and unix socket handling for PHP. The library also provides interface for implementing self inter-process communication via external services.

## Feature Highlights

Dazzle Socket features:

* Asynchronous handling of incoming and outcoming messages,
* Support for TCP, UDP and Unix sockets,
* ...and more.

## Provided Example(s)

### Quickstart

Server file which accepts the range in format of $min-$max and returns randomized number.

```php
$loop = new Loop(new SelectLoop);
$server = new SocketListener('tcp://127.0.0.1:2080', $loop);

$server->on('connect', function($server, SocketInterface $client) {
    $client->write("Hello!\n");
    $client->write("Welcome to Dazzle server!\n");
    $client->write("Tell me a range and I will randomize a number for you!\n\n");

    $client->on('data', function(SocketInterface $client, $data) use(&$buffer) {
        $client->write("Your number is: " . rand(...explode('-', $data)));
    });
});

$loop->onStart(function() use($server) {
    $server->start();
});
$loop->start();
```

Client file which sends the $min-$max format to the above server and gets the response.

```php
$loop = new Loop(new SelectLoop);
$socket = new Socket('tcp://127.0.0.1:2080', $loop);

$socket->on('data', function($socket, $data) {
    printf("%s", $data);
});
$socket->write('1-100');

$loop->start();
```

## Versioning

Versioning of Dazzle libraries is being shared between all packages included in [Dazzle Project](https://github.com/dazzle-php/dazzle). That means the releases are being made concurrently for all of them. On one hand this might lead to "empty" releases for some packages at times, but don't worry. In the end it is far much easier for contributors to maintain and -- what's the most important -- much more straight-forward for users to understand the compatibility and inter-operability of the packages.
